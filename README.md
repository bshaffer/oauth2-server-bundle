# OAuth2 Server Bundle

OAuth2 Server Bundle for Symfony 2.

## Overview

Currently only supports the Client Credentials grant type. More to follow.

You can make token requests to the `/token` path via POST.

## Installation

### Step 1: Add package to Composer

Add the bundle to your composer.json:

``` js
{
    "require": {
        "bshaffer/oauth2-server-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Now tell composer to download the bundle by running the command:

``` bash
$ php composer.phar update bshaffer/oauth2-server-bundle
```

Composer will install the bundle to your project's `vendor/bshaffer` directory.

### Step 2: Enable the bundle

Enable the bundle in the kernel:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new OAuth2\ServerBundle\OAuth2ServerBundle(),
    );
}
```

### Step 3: Install database

You'll need to update your schema to setup the Entities provided by this module.

``` bash
$ php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

### Step 4: Add routes

You'll need to add the following to your routing.yml

``` yaml
# app/config/routing.yml

oauth2_server:
    resource: "@OAuth2ServerBundle/Controller/"
    type:     annotation
    prefix:   /
```

## Optional Configuration

You can override any of the built-in components in your own bundle by adding new parameters in your config.yml:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml

parameters:
    oauth2.storage.client_credentials.class: Amce\OAuth2ServerBundle\Storage\ClientCredentials
```

Where `Amce\OAuth2ServerBundle\Storage\ClientCredentials` is your own implementation of the ClientCredentials interface.

If you provide your own storage managers then you'll be able to hook everything up to your own custom Entities.

## User Credentials (Resource Owner Password)

To make it easy to plug-in your own User Provider we've conformed to the `UserInterface`, `UserProviderInterface` & `EncoderFactoryInterface`.

Therefore to make proper use of the user credentials grant type you'll need to modify your config.yml with the relevant classes.

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml

parameters:
    oauth2.user_provider.class: Amce\OAuth2ServerBundle\User\OAuth2UserProvider
```

If you want to take advantage of scope restriction on a per user basis your User entity will need to implement the `OAuth2\ServerBundle\OAuth2UserInterface` or `OAuth2\ServerBundle\AdvancedOAuth2UserInterface`.

Out of the box we do provide a basic user provider and entity for you to use. Setup your security.yml to use it:

```yaml
# app/config/security.yml

security:
    encoders:
        OAuth2\ServerBundle\Entity\User:
            algorithm:          sha512
            encode_as_base64:   true
            iterations:         5000

    providers:
        oauth2:
            id: oauth2.user_provider
```

You'll need some users first though! Use the console command to create a new user:

```sh
$ app/console OAuth2:CreateUser username password
```
